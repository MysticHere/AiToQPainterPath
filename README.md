This is a multi-stage C++ Qt application designed to convert Adobe Illustrator (.ai) files into a QPainterPath object. The workflow is as follows: AI to Image SVG: It first uses the Poppler library to render the input .ai file into a raster image, which it saves as a temporary SVG file. Image SVG to Vector SVG: It then loads this image-based SVG, intelligently extracts the outline of the rendered content into a QPainterPath, and saves that path into a second, clean SVG file containing only vector data. Vector SVG to QPainterPath: Finally, it uses a custom, low-level XML parser (QXmlStreamReader) to read the clean SVG file and manually parse the path data into a QPainterPath object within the application. The application displays both the original rendered image and the final parsed path outline on top of it, and allows the user to save the result as either a PNG image or a new, clean SVG file.
